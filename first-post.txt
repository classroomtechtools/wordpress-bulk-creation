<h1><strong>Hello and welcome to your SSIS <em>Blogfolio</em>!</strong></h1>
A Blogfolio is a little bit Blog, a little bit Portfolio. It is a place where you can share your SSIS learning and reflections, connect and learn from other people, and practice how to be an effective digital citizen.

It's exciting! And it's also a responsibility. Together, we'll start a journey to learn how to best use this Blogfolio to enhance and extend your learning.

A few notes:

This Blogfolio is semi-public. It will not come up when people search for it in Google, but you can still share the URL address with family and friends.

Please do this! Encourage family and friends to subscribe to your Blogfolio and leave helpful comments.

At the moment you are an "editor" of your Blogfolio. This means you can add posts, but you can't change the colours, images, or themes. At some point during the year (once you have proven you can use your Blogfolio responsibly) you'll be given Administrator access. Then you can choose whatever weird colours you want!

Please bookmark your blog, and make sure to memorize your username and password.

If you have any problems, please ask your teacher or one of the Learning Technology Coaches.

That's it!

Now, lets learn how to use this thing!
